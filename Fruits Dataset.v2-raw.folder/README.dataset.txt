# Overview

The `Fruits` dataset is an image classification dataset of various fruits against white backgrounds from various angles, originally open sourced by GitHub user [horea](https://github.com/Horea94/Fruit-Images-Dataset). This is a subset of that full dataset.

# Use Cases

Build a fruit classifier! This could be a just-for-fun project just as much as you could be building a [color sorter for agricultural use cases](https://www.agriexpo.online/agricultural-manufacturer/color-sorter-3884.html) before fruits make their way to market.

# Using this Dataset

Use the `fork` button to copy this dataset to your own Roboflow account and export it with new preprocessing settings (perhaps resized for your model's desired format or converted to grayscale), or additional augmentations to make your model generalize better. This particular dataset would be very well suited for Roboflow's new advanced [Bounding Box Only Augmentations](https://blog.roboflow.ai/introducing-bounding-box-level-augmentations/).
